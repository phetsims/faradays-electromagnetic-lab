In Java version, (0,0) is in upper-left of screen, +x is right, +y is down.  Change this for HTML5 version.

Make compass follow B-field immediately when clock is paused

Drag bounds for magnets and coils constrained to layoutBounds

Drag bounds for compass and field meter constrained to visibleBounds, move inside if needed

Collision detection only in Pickup Coil screen, between bar magnet and pickup coil,

Make compass work inside bar magnet

Loop Area instead of Loop Radius

Reset All in Generator screen should not light the bulb

One model element to describe all electrons, one view element to render all electrons

DESIGN ISSUE: Should we label voltmeter probes with +/- ?  It will be the opposite of the voltmeter gauge, and opposite of
faradays-law.

DESIGN ISSUE: Resistor in Java version makes no sense, there is no such thing as a 3-band resistor with a tolerance
band, and its value was 0. I've implemented a 4-band resistor, whose color-coding is currently 0 +-5%.  So the color
coding needs to be set, see https://www.utmel.com/tools/band-resistor-color-code-calculator?id=20.
I've also made the resistor flat, without rounded ends, which I think works better in the limited space available
(worst case 1 loop).
