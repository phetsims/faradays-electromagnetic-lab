MathCAD for 1G bar magnet.

Pickup Coil models Faraday's Law. Induced EMF is used to derive current amplitude.

Electromagnet also sets current amplitude based on the type of power supply (DC or AC)
and the setting for the power supply (voltage, frequency).

Electrons in the pickup coil and electromagnet move based on current amplitude.

Light bulb and voltmeter respond to current amplitude in the pickup coil.
