These files are the precomputed B-field for a bar magnet, copied from the Java version of this simulation, computed
using a version of MathCAD circa 2004.

The MathCAD model can be found in .xmcd (MathCAD) and .pdf formats at doc/java-version/bFieldOfHorizCylinderNumerical.*

See BarMagnetFieldData.ts and BarMagnetFieldGrid.ts for additional documentation.

See faradays-electromagnetic-lab/scripts/cvsToArray.sh for the script that was used to convert .csv files into
the JavaScript code found in BarMagnetFieldData.ts.
